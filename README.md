# Rugix Yocto Layers

This repository provides Yocto layers for integrating [Rugix Ctrl](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl) into a custom, [Yocto-based](https://www.yoctoproject.org) Linux distribution tailored to your embedded device.
Rugix Ctrl **enables secure and efficient over-the-air (OTA) updates and provides robust state management capabilities** designed to streamline the development and maintenance of embedded Linux devices at scale.
Rugix Ctrl is part of the [Rugix Project](https://rugix.org).

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is **work-in-progress and not intended for production use** at this time.
> We appreciate any feedback you may have regarding this Yocto integration.
> Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/silitics/meta-rugix/issues/new/choose).

Rugix Ctrl has all features you would expect from a state-of-the-art update solution and more:

- **Atomic A/B system updates** with popular bootloaders out of the box.
- **Streaming updates** as well as **adaptive delta updates** out of the box.
- Builtin **cryptographic integrity checks** _before_ installing anything anywhere.
- Supports **any update scenario**, including **non-A/B updates and incremental updates**.
- Supports **any bootloader and boot process** through [custom _boot flows_](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/boot-flows).
- **Robust state management mechanism** inspired by container-based architectures.
- Integrates well with [different fleet management solutions](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/fleet-management) (avoids vendor lock-in).
- Provides powerful interfaces to built your own update workflow upon.

Rugix Ctrl **supports or can be adapted to almost any requirements you may have** when it comes to robust and secure updates of your entire system as well as its individual components.

For details, check out [Rugix Ctrl's documentation](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl) and the [documentation on the Yocto layers](https://oss.silitics.com/rugix/docs/ctrl/advanced/yocto-integration/).

## Getting Started

We provide [kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas)-based [examples](./examples/) to help you get started quickly.

## Provided Layers

The layer [`meta-rugix-core`](./meta-rugix-core/) provides everything required for installing Rugix Ctrl and building Rugix-compatible update bundles.
In addition the following board-specific layers are provided:

- [`meta-rugix-rpi-tryboot`](./meta-rugix-rpi-tryboot/): BSP layer for building Raspberry Pi images with [`tryboot`](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#fail-safe-os-updates-tryboot) support. This layer has so far only been tested on Raspberry Pi 5.

The board-specific layers serve as **examples** for how to integrate Rugix Ctrl with specific boards.
Depending on your project and requirements, you may need to adapt those layers or write your own.
